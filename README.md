This project is about  developing a data based numerical algorithm which can compute the linking Number of a Hopf link and a two component unlink to compare and distinguish between the two. So far we have succesfully computed and distinguished between the Hopf link and unlink. Next on the line we are aiming for generalising the algorithm for n-component Hopf rings and unlink.

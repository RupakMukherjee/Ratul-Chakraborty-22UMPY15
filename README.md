This project focuses on developing a data-based numerical algorithm capable of computing the linking number of a two-component Hopf link and a two-component Unlink. The primary objective is to compare and distinguish between the two. Successfully computed, the linking numbers of the Hopf link and the Unlink provided a basis for differentiation using the code in the Linkage.py file.

Subsequently, the algorithm was generalized to compute the linking number (Helicity) for any given n-component Hopf link, where n=2,3,4,5, and so on. This generalization allows for the distinction between different components. The code for this generalized algorithm is provided in the n_component_HELICITY.py file.

Moving forward, we next aim for applying these algorithms to various data-driven physical phenomena.

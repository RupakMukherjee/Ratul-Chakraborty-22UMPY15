# URGENT!. Sir, Kindly change the root directory to "main" in the settings.
Sir, I have accidenatlly merged the gh-pages with the mainline without realising the github page settings. I am not the owner, only you can change the root directory to the main branch in the settings. Then only the page shall work. Sorry for this. But I have forked the repo into my account. I am continuing the work in my account for now. Later I can merge it with your repo using a pull request.

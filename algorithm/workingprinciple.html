                A German mathematician, Herbert Seifert, provided a valuable algorithm known as Seifert's Algorithm. 
                In this algorithm, he proved that for any knot or link, one can construct an orientable surface with the knot 
                or link as its surface boundary. These surfaces are named after him and are called Seifert Surfaces.

                Look at the images shown below. In the first image, there is an orientable surface with 
                the Borromean ring as its boundary. In the second image, there is an orientable surface with the Hopf link as its boundary. 
                In the last image, there are two sides of an orientable disk surface with the unknot as its boundary.

            <h3 class="subheading">Connecting the Dots: Linking Number of a Link</h3>
            <p>
                Being familiar with the concept of Seifert surfaces, let's attempt to use its feature of orientability 
                to calculate the linking number of a link. Consider a link \(L\) consisting of two knots, \(K1\) and \(K2\).
            </p>

            <div class="image-center">
                <figure>
                    <img src="algorithm/image/m3.1.jpg" alt="Link of two oriented trefoils" class="img-fluid">

                </figure>
                
            </div>

            <p>
                We select one of the knots, say the red one, and construct its Seifert surface. 
                We then count how many times the blue knot crosses the red Seifert surface. 
                Each time it crosses from the top to the bottom side, we count it as -1; from bottom to top as +1. 
                The modulus of the sum of these values is the linking number of the link.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>The linking number for an unlink is always 0, regardless of the deformations, as the loops do not cross each otherâ€™s Seifert surfaces.</p>

            <h3 class="subheading">Linking Number of Hopf Link</h3>

            </div>
            <p>The linking number for the Hopf link is 1, independent of its orientation or deformation, since  it  crosses the blue seifert surface once, either top to bottom or bottom to top. This distinguishes it topologically from an unlink.</p>

## Usage
You only need to worry about the '#Register your data' and the '#Call Identify_Links' section of the script. You can safely ignore everything else. Follow the instructions as follows.
<br>
- In the '#Register your data' section assign an empty list '[]' to the variable 'Time_stamp' as Time_stamp=[].
- Update the list empty list 'Time_stamp' as Time_stamp=[a,b,c,d,e,....]. Note each entries of the list 'Time_stamp' is an individual list representing data points of a distict loop.  
- In the '#Call Identify_Links' section call the function 'Identify_Links' with the data list 'Time_stamp' as Identify_links(Time_stamp).
- An example is illustrated in the script.
- Save the file and run the script.
- You can include as many as loops as you want in the list 'Time_stamp' to find out how many of them are interlinked.

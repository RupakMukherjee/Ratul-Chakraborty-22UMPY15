## Usage
You only need to worry about the '#Register your data' section of the script. You can safely ignore everything else. You only need to edit the variable named 'Link' as follows.
<br>
- Assign an empty list '[]' to the variable 'Link' as Link=[]
- Add two empty lists inside the above list as Link=[[],[]]
- Choose two data sets from the linkage_data.txt file. Say for example 'DATA SET 1: HOPF LINK' and 'DATA SET 2: UNLINK'. Note each data set has two lists in it. Say 'a' and 'b' 
- Copy both the data lists 'a' and 'b' from a data set and paste them into one of the empty lists in 'Link' as '[a,b]'. Repeat the same for the other data set.
- The final list should look something like this: Link=[[a,b],[c,d]]
- Save the file and run the script.

## Usage
You only need to worry about the '#Register your data' and the '#Comparison' section of the script. You can safely ignore everything else. Follow the instructions as follows.
<br>
- In the '#Register your data' add two variables. Say 'L1' and 'L2'. 
- Assign an empty list '[]' to each of the variable 'L1' and 'L2' as L1=[] and L2=[].
- For comparison between a 2-component hopf ring and 3-component hopf ring update 'L1' and 'L2' as L1=[a,b] and L2=[c,d,e]. Note each of the entries 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' is an individual list.
- In the '#Comparison' section update 'H1' as H1=n_component_Helicity(L1) and 'H2' as H2=n_component_Helicity(L2)
- An example is illustrated in the script.
- Save the file and run the script.
- Follow the above steps to compare structures with any number of components 'n' starting from n=2 and so on.

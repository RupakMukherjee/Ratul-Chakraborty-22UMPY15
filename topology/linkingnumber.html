        <h1>Linking Number</h1>
        <p>
            The linking number, a topological invariant for a given link, represents the linking of two knots or links in three-dimensional space. Various methods are available to measure it for a particular link, each offering a distinct perspective:

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Vector Calculus Method:</strong> Involves the use of vector calculus and line integrals to express the linking number in terms of the vector functions representing the two curves.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Gauss's Linking Number Formula:</strong> Utilizes Gauss's formula, expressing the linking number as a line integral along one of the curves involving the tangent vector and the position vector of the other curve.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Writhe and Twist Method:</strong> Breaks down the linking number into the writhe and twist components, where the writhe represents the overall coiling of one curve around the other, and the twist measures local twisting.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Determinant Method:</strong> Involves constructing a determinant using the components of the tangent vectors of the two curves and integrating it over the entire curve.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Knot Diagram Method:</strong> Converts the curves into knot diagrams, simplifying the calculation of the linking number by counting the crossings in the diagram.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Homotopy Method:</strong> Utilizes homotopy theory to calculate the linking number by continuously deforming one curve to the other while monitoring a certain quantity related to the linking.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Algebraic Topology Methods:</strong> Leverages concepts from algebraic topology, such as homology and cohomology, to define and compute linking numbers in a more abstract and general framework.
